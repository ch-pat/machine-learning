Machine learning wants to produce a _model_ to predict the values of a certain _feature_ given a dataset
of values on which training can be done.

But what _is_ learning?
Understand -> Gain Knowledge -> Use knowledge to do something

How do we learn?
1. Someone tells us (a teacher)
2. Trial and error

But some things are difficult to learn or difficult to teach.
1. When the data is _too much_ it becomes difficult to make sense of it (patterns in dna)
2. When data changes too frequently it becomes difficult to adapt (recommendations and market stuff)
3. When the environment does not allow for error (rescue system, critical or expensive systems)
4. When the data is not enough or we do not understand what we need to teach (speech and image recognition
   in humans is not actually understood)

We can use Machine Learning for some of these instances
1. When human expertise is lacking or non-existent (case of speech recognition); when there is danger.
2. Data changes too frequently or is too much.
3. To design systems that would be otherwise too difficult or expensive to accomplish rigorously (manually)
4. To design systems that adapt themselves to different users
5. Obtain new knowledge from existing data (mining large databases)

Machine learning can be applied to basically every field; linguistics, finance, speech and image recognition...
